# ext-noise
Completely pure PHP extension containing Perlin Octaves Generator, Simplex Octaves Generator, Noise Map Generator, and Random class written in C++ from VanillaGenerator. This project is in the progress of being rewritten to be a standalone-generator extension, the source code for the new generator can be found [here](https://github.com/NetherGamesMC/extnoise/tree/2.0.0).

## Building the sources for Windows

### Prerequisite
You will have to install [Microsoft Visual Code Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) in order to successfully compile the extension. The following VC++ versions are required to install PHP specific versions:
- Visual C++ 14.0 (Visual Studio 2015) for PHP 7.0 or PHP 7.1.
- Visual C++ 15.0 (Visual Studio 2017) for PHP 7.2, PHP 7.3 or PHP 7.4.
- Visual C++ 16.0 (Visual Studio 2019) for PHP 8.0 and above.

### Setup
In your `.github` folder, run `install.ps1` script in a powershell console. The script will download all requires files to compile the extension. After this step, you will have to clone [ext-chunkutils2](https://github.com/pmmp/ext-chunkutils2) and [ext-morton](https://github.com/pmmp/ext-morton) into `C:\php\devel\include\ext` folder. The folder generated by the scripts can be different for each PHP versions, (e.g: `install-7.4.ps1` will install PHP 7.4 in `C:\php_7.4`).

After doing the steps above, you can finally execute `build.ps1` or `build-7.x.ps1` in the project root folder.

Your extension will be located in `x64\Release_TS`. Please ensure you have ext-noise extension enabled in your `php.ini` first.

## Building the sources for Linux
It is highly recommended to build the source using our [php-build-scripts](https://github.com/NetherGamesMC/php-build-scripts) since the project depends on ext-chunkutils2 and ext-morton.

## Stubs
Project stubs for PHPStorm auto-completion can be found [here](https://github.com/NetherGamesMC/extnoise/blob/master/stubs.php).
